OpenEdition provides bibliographic metadata for the documents published on `OpenEdition Books <https://books.openedition.org>`_ and `OpenEdition Journals <https://journals.openedition.org>`_ as `MARC records <http://www.loc.gov/marc/umb/>`_. Alternatively, OpenEdition metadata can be harvested using `OpenEdition OAI-PMH repository <https://oai-openedition.readthedocs.io/>`_.

OpenEdition MARC records are provided in `UNIMARC <https://www.ifla.org/publications/unimarc-formats-and-related-documentation>`_ or `MARC21 <http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/>`_ formats. Files provided are `ISO 2709 <https://www.iso.org/standard/41319.html>`_ compliant.

This documentation describes the specific elements related to OpenEdition but does not include a complete description of MARC specifications.
